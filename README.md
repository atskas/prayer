---------------------------------------
## How to build the `.iso`
### Linux
- Run `build.sh` as an executable.
- There you go! As long as you haven't tampered with anything, it should build `prayer.iso` in the project directory.

### Windows
- There is currently no build support for windows.

> I am planning on ditching the old `build.sh` file and using something like CMake, as I should have.
> This means possible Windows support for building, too!
